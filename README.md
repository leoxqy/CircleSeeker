**CircleSeeker** is a specialized bioinformatics pipeline designed for the identification, classification, and characterization of extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) from PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing data.

---

## Overview

Traditional methods for eccDNA identification are often platform-specific. Approaches for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data primarily rely on **Split-Read** reconstruction algorithms, while earlier methods for Nanopore long reads focused on directly identifying tandem repeat structures (**CTC reads**).

**CircleSeeker** innovatively combines the strengths of these two strategies, specifically optimized for the unique advantages of PacBio HiFi dataâ€”long read lengths and high accuracy. It first identifies potential circular structures by detecting tandem repeats within reads and then employs a Split-Read based strategy to precisely reconstruct large eccDNAs (>20 kb). This hybrid approach ensures the accurate and efficient recovery of complete eccDNA sequences.

Following identification, CircleSeeker automatically classifies each eccDNA based on its alignment pattern and chimerism, providing a powerful tool for investigating genome instability.

## Key Features

-   **Hybrid Detection Strategy**: Merges tandem repeat detection with Split-Read assembly, tailored to leverage the strengths of PacBio HiFi data for maximum recall and precision.
-   **Comprehensive eccDNA Classification**: Sorts eccDNA into biologically meaningful categories:
    -   **UeccDNA (Unique-locus eccDNA):** Originates from a single, contiguous genomic locus.
    -   **MeccDNA (Multi-locus eccDNA):** Composed of repetitive sequences (e.g., tandem repeats) that map to multiple genomic locations, but lacks a chimeric structure.
    -   **CeccDNA (Chimeric eccDNA):** A chimeric circle formed by the fusion of two or more distant, non-contiguous genomic segments.
    -   **MCeccDNA (Multi-locus Chimeric eccDNA):** A hybrid circle exhibiting both multi-locus and chimeric features.
    -   **XeccDNA:** Sequences that cannot be classified into the above categories, potentially representing contamination, other unknown circular molecules, or complex unclassified structures.
-   **Automated & Efficient Pipeline**: Integrates multiple third-party tools (e.g., TideHunter, BLAST, minimap2, samtools) into a single, cohesive workflow with multi-threading support.
-   **Checkpoint & Resumption**: Creates a checkpoint file after each major step, allowing the pipeline to be resumed from the last completed point in case of interruption.
-   **Detailed Analysis Reports**: Automatically generates an HTML summary report, comprehensive CSV tables, and final FASTA files for easy interpretation and downstream analysis.

## Installation

We currently recommend installing CircleSeeker by downloading a release package and installing it with Conda. More installation options will be available in the future.

### Option 1: From Release File (Recommended)

1.  **Navigate to the Releases Page**: Visit the project's [Releases page](https://github.com/leoxqy/CircleSeeker/releases).
2.  **Download the Package**: Download the latest `.tar.bz2` package (e.g., `circle_seeker-1.0.1-pyh2b07374_0.tar.bz2`).
3.  **Install with Conda**: Open your terminal, navigate to the download directory, and run:
    ```bash
    # Replace the filename with the version you downloaded
    conda install circle_seeker-1.0.1-pyh2b07374_0.tar.bz2
    ```

### Option 2: From Source (For Developers)

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/leoxqy/CircleSeeker.git](https://github.com/leoxqy/CircleSeeker.git)
    cd CircleSeeker
    ```
2.  **Install with pip**:
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```
    **Important**: If installing from source, ensure the following dependencies are in your system's `$PATH`:
    `minimap2`, `samtools`, `blast+`, `seqkit`, `mosdepth`, `bcftools`, `tidehunter`.

## Test Data Setup

### Download Required Test Data

**Reference Genome (CHM13v2.0):**
```bash
# Download CHM13v2.0 reference genome (~900MB)
wget https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/assemblies/analysis_set/chm13v2.0.fa.gz
gunzip chm13v2.0.fa.gz
```

**Test Sample Data:**
- Use `HeLa_rep1_1k.fasta` - a 1kb subset of HeLa cell PacBio HiFi reads containing eccDNA candidates
- This file should be obtained from the original CircleSeeker2 development dataset
- Alternatively, use any PacBio HiFi FASTA file containing potential eccDNA sequences

## Example Workflow

1.  **Prepare Input Files**
    -   PacBio HiFi Reads: `HeLa_rep1_1k.fasta`
    -   Reference Genome: `chm13v2.0.fa`

2.  **Run CircleSeeker**
    ```bash
    CircleSeeker \
        -i HeLa_rep1_1k.fasta \
        -p HeLa_test \
        -r chm13v2.0.fa \
        -t 16 \
        --enable_X
    ```

3.  **Check the Results**
    -   Review the output files in the specified directory.
    -   Open `HeLa_test.report.html` for a visual summary of the analysis.
    -   Confirm successful completion by checking the `HeLa_test.checkpoint` file.

## Output Files

The pipeline generates several output files. The most important ones include:

-   `<prefix>.Final.Confirmed.{Uecc,Mecc,Cecc,MCecc}.{csv,fasta}`: Tables and sequences for eccDNA types confirmed by coverage analysis.

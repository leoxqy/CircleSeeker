# Documentation

This folder hosts project documentation and assets to keep the repository root tidy.

- Testing guide: `testing/HOW_TO_USE_TESTS.md` (use `./scripts/run_tests.sh` or `make test`)
- Technical plan: `Technical_Reconstruction_Plan.md`
- Images and figures: `assets/`
- Module rename mapping: `Module_Renames.md`

Guideline: keep long-form guides, diagrams, and reference docs here. Keep the root focused on code and top-level metadata such as `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
